This repo is for group 05 doing project 10.

10. Title: Comparison of MPC Techniques
Abstract: There are several techniques to perform multi-party 
computing among which include linear secret sharing and garbled circuits.
In this project, we will compare these two techniques over a simple machine learning 
algorithm chosen by the group members (any simple algorithm would do) in terms of security/privacy and efficiency.
